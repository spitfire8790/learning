# How Websites Work

## What is a website?

Imagine a website as a digital book. Just like a book has pages made of paper with text and images, a website has digital pages that display content in your web browser. There are three main ingredients that make up every website:

### 1. HTM - The Structure

Hyper Text Markup Langugage (HTML) is like the skeleton of our digital book. It tells the browser what things are - which text is a heading, which is a paragraph, what's a button, and so on. If our website was a house, HTML would be the walls, doors, and windows that give it its basic shape.
For example, when you see a news article online with a big headline at the top, a few paragraphs below, and maybe some images, that's all structured using HTML.

### 2. CSS - The Style

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is like the interior decorator of our website. It decides how everything looks - the colors, sizes, spacing, and arrangement. Going back to our house analogy, CSS would be the paint on the walls, the style of furniture, and how everything is arranged.

When you notice that some text is blue, centered on the page, or that a button changes color when you hover over it - that's all CSS at work.

### 3. JavaScript - The Interaction

JavaScript makes things happen on the page. It's like having a butler in our house who responds to requests and makes changes. When you click a button and something happens, or when a form checks if you've entered a valid email address - that's JavaScript in action.

## How does it all work together?

Let's use a real word example - social media post:

**HTML provides the structure:**

- The post has a title
- There's a space for the main content
- There are buttons for liking and sharing


**CSS makes it look good:**

- The title is larger than regular text
- The post has a white background with a subtle shadow
- The buttons are blue and nicely rounded

**JavaScript makes it interactive:**

- When you click 'like', the count goes up
- When you click 'share', a menu pops up
- As you scroll, new posts load automatically

## What happens when you visit a website?

When you type a website address (like www.google.com) into your browser:

1. Your browser sends a request to that website's server (think of it like calling a library to request a book)
   
2. The server sends back the website files (like the library sending you the book)

3. Your browser reads these files and assembles them into the website you see (like opening and reading the book)
